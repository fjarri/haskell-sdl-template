Haskell SDL template
====================

This package contains all necessary infrastructure to start a cross-platform SDL application. It contains some C magic that SDL requires, provides an example ``.cabal`` file, contains code that packs the application into standalone ``.app``/``.exe`` etc.

The program itself is ``SDLTemplate.hs``; it is very simple and only shows an image for 2 seconds to demonstrate that SDL is working correctly.
